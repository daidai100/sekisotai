## Concept
- Characters can be engraved on the sides of FEM 3D printed objects without support.
- Assumes that characters will be arranged horizontally.
- Alpha version, so only uppercase alphabet characters are included.

## Notes
- Inspired by 7-segment displays and dot fonts.
- Supported based on the idea of ​​stencil fonts.
- We would like to eventually support vertical arrangements.
- Design rules based on functionality.
